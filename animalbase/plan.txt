FILTER:
- try hardcode filter (only cats) NB: hardcoding betyder man bare får filtreringen til at virke i consollen uden at få det til at virke med kanpper
- filter either cats or Dogs
- add user "all"- filter
- add some cleanup

SORTING: 
- try hardcode sorting by name 
- add user interactivity 
- a more generic sort function? 
- chance sort direction
- add cleanup 

FINAL:
- combining filter and sort

STARS
- remember modal (the data), view (filter, sorting and stars) and controller (user experience, clicks etc)
1. MODAL 
- add start to animal 
2. View 
- add visible (fixed star) to each animal on the list
- get the star status from the modal and display that in the list (if selected or not)
3. controller
- add user interactivity to turn stars on/off

WINNERS
1. MODAL
- add winner status
2. View
- add visible winners (fixed values) in the list
- get winner status from modal and display that in the list 
3. controller
- fake winners test (add a toggle btn so each animal can be winners/not winners)
-  design logic and the rules
- implement the logic with functions with lot of basic functions
- add user interface into logic 
4. view (again) hardcoded dialog boxes
- ask user if they want to ignore or remove A or B
ask user if they want to ignore or remove other
- dynamic dialog boxes
